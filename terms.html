        <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including text, design, source code, branding, and related content (excluding open-source components
            under their own licenses), is owned by the app developer and protected by applicable laws.</p>
        <p>You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal,
            non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent
            permitted by law, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the app developer and its affiliates, officers, employees, and
            service providers are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
            or any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or digital assets, arising from or related to use of the
            App.</p>
        <p>Our total liability for all claims related to the App will not exceed the amount you paid for the App (or
            related subscriptions) in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the app developer and its affiliates from claims,
            liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the
            App or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>14. Suspension and Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the App (or parts of it) if required by law, platform policy, security
            concerns, or material violations of these Terms.</p>
        <p>Sections that by nature should survive termination (including disclaimers, limitations, indemnification, and
            governing law) will survive.</p>

        <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms. Changes become effective when posted with an updated effective date. Continued use
            of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Norway, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
