**Effective date:** 2026-02-18
**App:** Bitcoin Tracker
**Contact:** proventuspro@protonmail.com

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy explains how Bitcoin Tracker ("we", "our", "us") handles information when you use the mobile application.

## 2. Data We Process

### 2.1 Data you enter

- Portfolio transaction entries (amounts, prices, notes, timestamps).
- Wallet addresses you choose to track.
- App preferences (currency, display settings, feature toggles).

### 2.2 Data from device/app usage

- Notification permission status and local notification settings.
- App diagnostics needed for core functionality (when available from platform APIs).

### 2.3 Subscription and purchase data

If you use paid features, subscription and entitlement events are processed via Apple and RevenueCat (our subscription infrastructure provider), such as:

- Product identifiers.
- Purchase state / entitlement status.
- Anonymous app user identifiers used for subscription state.

### 2.4 Market/network data

The app requests public market and blockchain-related data from third-party endpoints (for example, pricing and network statistics providers). Those providers may receive your IP address and standard request metadata.

## 3. How We Use Data

We use data to:

- Deliver app functionality (charts, alerts, portfolio analytics).
- Sync/validate subscription entitlement status.
- Improve reliability and prevent abuse.
- Respond to support requests.

We do not sell your personal data.

## 4. Tracking and Advertising

Bitcoin Tracker is not designed for cross-app advertising tracking.
If this changes, we will update this policy and request required platform permissions.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

- Portfolio and alert data is stored locally on your device by default.
- Subscription entitlement data is managed by Apple/RevenueCat as required for purchases.
- Retention duration depends on your device state, app uninstall, and provider retention policies.

## 6. Data Sharing

We may share limited data with service providers strictly to operate the app:

- **RevenueCat** (subscription management).
- **Apple** (in-app purchase processing).
- **Market/network data providers** used by the app.

We may disclose information if required by law.

## 7. Your Choices

You can:

- Delete local app data from in-app settings (where available) or by uninstalling the app.
- Disable notifications at the OS level.
- Manage subscriptions in your Apple ID subscription settings.

## 8. Children

The app is not directed to children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).

## 9. International Transfers

Service providers may process data in countries different from your residence. We rely on provider safeguards where applicable.

## 10. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No system is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date and, where required, providing notice.
