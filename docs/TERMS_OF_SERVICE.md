Bitcoin Tracker provides tools such as Bitcoin price tracking, analytics, alerts, and portfolio tracking.
The App does not execute trades, hold custody of assets, or provide brokerage services.

All information in the App is for informational purposes only and is not financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.
You are solely responsible for your investment and financial decisions.

You are responsible for:

- All activity on your device and platform account.

## 6. Subscriptions, Billing, and Trials

Some features require a paid subscription ("HODLER PRO") or one-time purchase.

- Pricing, billing period, and trial terms are shown before purchase.
- Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled before renewal through your platform account settings.
- Refunds are subject to the platform's policies (for iOS, Apple policies apply).

## 7. User Data and Privacy

Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy: `docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`.
Please review it to understand how data is processed.

The App may display data from third-party providers. We do not guarantee third-party data is accurate, complete, or uninterrupted.

You acknowledge:

- Market data can be delayed or unavailable.
- Network/API outages can impact app behavior.
- Calculations and analytics are estimates.

## 9. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Interfere with, disrupt, or degrade App operation.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt unauthorized access except where permitted by law.
- Abuse notifications, APIs, or platform systems.

## 10. Intellectual Property

The App, including text, design, source code, branding, and related content (excluding open-source components under their own licenses), is owned by [Your Legal Entity Name] and protected by applicable laws.

You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.

## 11. Disclaimers

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, [Your Legal Entity Name] and its affiliates, officers, employees, and service providers are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or digital assets, arising from or related to use of the App.

Our total liability for all claims related to the App will not exceed the amount you paid for the App (or related subscriptions) in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [Your Legal Entity Name] and its affiliates from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.

## 14. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the App (or parts of it) if required by law, platform policy, security concerns, or material violations of these Terms.

Sections that by nature should survive termination (including disclaimers, limitations, indemnification, and governing law) will survive.

## 15. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms. Changes become effective when posted with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
