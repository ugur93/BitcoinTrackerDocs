## Description
Bitcoin Tracker is built for one asset: Bitcoin.

Most multicoin apps optimize for ticker lists and noise.
Bitcoin Tracker is built for signal, conviction, and execution.

What you can do:
- Track BTC in real time with clean, interactive charts.
- Monitor price action across your preferred fiat markets.
- Set above/below alerts and review trigger history.
- Follow Bitcoin network health: block height, mempool pressure, fees, supply progress, and halving ETA.
- Track your stack using both wallet addresses and manual transactions.
- Edit transaction metadata (classification, cost basis, fees, notes) for clearer P&L.
- Import/export transactions (CSV/PDF) for external workflows.
- Set a stack goal in BTC and track remaining sats to target.

Why Bitcoin-only beats multicoin trackers:
- No altcoin clutter, no coin-hopping UX, no distraction.
- Bitcoin-native context first: halving cycles, ATH drawdowns, DCA outcomes, and macro correlation.
- Built for stackers who want depth, speed, and clarity in one app.

HODLER PRO unlocks:
- Technical analysis with indicator overlays and signal summaries.
- Cycles & halving analysis, monthly returns heatmaps, and drawdown intelligence.
- Correlation (BTC vs S&P, Nasdaq, Gold), corporate treasury tracking, and advanced analytics.
- Live 1-second price updates and expanded limits.

Privacy and control:
- Portfolio data and preferences are stored locally on your device.
- No brokerage execution. No custodial wallet functionality.

Important:
- Bitcoin Tracker provides market data and portfolio tools.
- It does not provide financial, investment, or tax advice.
