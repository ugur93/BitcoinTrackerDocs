- Monitor price across different fiat currencies.
- Set custom price alerts to get notified when it matters.
- Check network stats: block height, fees, and halving progress.
- Track your portfolio by adding wallet addresses or entering transactions manually.
- Organize your history with notes and cost basis editing.
- Export your data (CSV/PDF) for your own records.
- Set a goal and track your progress in satoshis.

Designed for focus:
- No altcoin clutter or distractions.
- Built-in tools for halving cycles and DCA calculations.
- Clean, dark-mode interface that’s easy on the eyes.

Privacy first:
- Your portfolio data stays on your device.

- We don't track your identity or sell your data.
